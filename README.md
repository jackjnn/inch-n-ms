## Challenge: Build a one-screen app to convert inches to meters

I got his from the following prompt in a sample tech test

Developer Stories

- [x]  Create resource file
- [x]  create class file
- [x]  add fields
- [x]  Read input and pass to output
- [x]  add click listener
- [x]  Check for edge cases
- [x]  Careful with Null vs Empty conditions


This app was fun to build. The trickiest part was complications that arose from null vs empty checks. Also converting the edit text to string to double and vice versa was a bit tricky but a fun afternoon project.
